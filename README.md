# Bash
A few bash scripts, nothing fancy.

## How to use scripts
In order to run the bash scripts each one needs to be given executable rights. This can be done with `chmod a+x FileName.sh` not sure if this is the best way to do it but it's been working for now. They should all have executable rights already but just in case. You can run the command by using `./FileName.sh` with in the current directory.

If you want to be able to run the scripts from anywhere you can move the scripts into your PATH, preferably in `/usr/local/bin`. Might need to be done as superuser. You can then run the sript with just `FileName.sh`
