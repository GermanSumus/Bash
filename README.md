# Bash
A few bash scripts, nothing fancy

## How to use scripts
In order to run the bash scripts each one needs to be given executable rights. You can do so with `chmod a+x FileName.sh` not sure if this is the best way to do it but it's been working for now. You can run the command by using `./FileName.sh` with in the current directory.

If you want to be able to run the scripts from anywhere you can move the scripts into your PATH, preferably in /usr/local/bin. Might need to be done as superuser. Run the sript with just `FileName.sh`
